## 📊 FIFA Women’s World Cup Participation & Income-Level Analysis

This project explores global participation in the FIFA Women’s World Cup through the lens of economic inequality. Using data on team qualifications and semi-final appearances from 1991 to 2019, the visualizations highlight disparities between high-income and lower-income nations.

### 🔍 Key Insights:
- Only 36 out of 195 countries have qualified for at least one Women’s World Cup as of 2019.
- African and Asian countries are underrepresented—likely due to a high concentration of lower-middle-income and low-income nations in these regions.
- All semi-finalist countries are high-income, except China and Brazil, which are upper-middle-income.
- The USA has dominated the tournament with 8 semi-final appearances, followed by Germany with 5.

### 💡 Purpose:
This project aims to:
- Visualize how economic status correlates with World Cup participation.
- Encourage reflection on the structural barriers facing lower-income countries in global women's football.
- Raise the question of whether the current qualification system could be made more inclusive.

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:

### 📌 Next Steps:
